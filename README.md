## File Naming:
- Elevator.java:
  - This file is used to select floors and indicate the floors selected, and to indicate the location of the elevator itself
- Floor.java:
  - This file is used to simulate the arrival of passengers to the elevators
- Scheduler.java:
  - This file is responsible for routing each elevator to requested floors

## Set Up:
- I'm not ðŸ’¯ on how this is to be set up(probably just start with the scheduler then the elevator and the floor and send a request from the floor to the scheduler)
